Design an algorithm that given an integer n returns an array [a,b] :

a is obtained by reversing the digits in the n

b is obtained by reversing the last two digits in a, or a if that reversal doesn't make a larger number than a

Example :

largestValue(95659512354) => [45321595659,45321595695]
largestValue(19659512354) => [45321595691,45321595691]
